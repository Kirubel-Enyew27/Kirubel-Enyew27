👋 Hi, I’m Kirubel-Enyew
👀 I’m interested in web development, software development, and data science.
🌱 I’m currently learning front-end web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as popular web frameworks like React and Node.js.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects that involve web development or software development.
